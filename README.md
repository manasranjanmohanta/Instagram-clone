# Instagram Clone

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a basic Instagram clone using HTML and CSS. The goal is to replicate the core visual elements and layout of the Instagram app.

## Functionality (Basic)

While this is a basic clone, it can potentially include these features:

- **Static Profile Page:** Simulate a user's profile with a profile picture, username, follower and following counts, and a grid of uploaded images.
- **Image Grid:** Display a grid of image placeholders or sample images to mimic the Instagram feed layout.
- **Navigation Bar:** Include basic navigation elements like a search bar, home button, and profile icon. *(Optional)*

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Provides the core structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** Styles the HTML elements to achieve the desired visual design for the Instagram clone.

## File Structure

A simple file structure can be used to organize your code:


## Development Steps

### HTML Structure:

- Create the `index.html` file and define the basic HTML structure for the page.
- Include elements like header, navigation bar (optional), profile section, and image grid section.

### CSS Styling:

- Create the `styles.css` file and start writing CSS rules to style the HTML elements.
- Focus on replicating the layout and design elements of Instagram, such as header background, navigation buttons, profile picture styling, and image grid layout with borders and spacing.

### Optional: Images

- If you want to include images for the profile picture or sample images in the grid, place them in an `images` directory and reference them using the `src` attribute in your HTML code.

## Testing and Running

Once you've developed the HTML structure and basic CSS styling, open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the progress. You can use browser developer tools to inspect and refine the styles as needed.

## Additional Considerations

- **Responsiveness:** Consider using CSS media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.
- **Advanced Features:** Explore adding functionalities like interactive buttons, image carousels, and more complex layouts in the future.

## Conclusion

This README provides a starting point for building a simple Instagram clone using HTML and CSS. Remember to experiment and explore different CSS techniques to achieve the desired visual effects.
